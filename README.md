# Medical_insurance_cost_prediction
This project contains a machine learning model to predict the medical insurance cost.  Linear Regression was done and modules like sklearn, pandas etc were used. The language used is python. 
Following steps were performed:

1) Data Exploration: Visualization of various features by distribution graphs and interpreting them to gain various insights. (Module used: matplotlib and seaborn)
2) Data Pre-Processing: Firstly, we encode the categorical variables by methods like One-Hot Encoding, assigning dummy variables and manual assignment. Secondly, we split the target and features. Finally, we split the data into training data and testing data. (Module used: sklearn, numpy)
3) Model Training: First we call the LinearRegression() function. Then we proceed to evaluate our model by predicting training values & testing values, and their R-squared. Lastly, we show the residual value via graph.
4) Building a predictive system.

CSV file (insurance.csv) used in this project is taken from Kaggle.
